# Display Color Profile
Copy the .icm files from the [ColorProfile](https://github.com/johnnync13/Xiaomi-Mi-Air/tree/master/ColorProfile) folder to /Library/ColorSync/Profiles/ and pick one in System Preferences, Displays, Color tab. They have different white balance levels so pick whichever you like.
